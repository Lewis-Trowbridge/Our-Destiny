# Destiny 2 API Python
## First off, let me say that this is by no means finished.
Now that that's out of the way, why don't we get started?

## What is this even about?

To put it simply, this is an API client for the Destiny 2 API written in Python. To not, read on:

This was born from my curiosity and love for the game - as much as I feel like I'm doing proper works a disservice by
calling this a "passion project", that is what this is. I love a lot of things about Destiny, and one of those is the
open access to your own data, so I decided to see what I could do with my baseline knowledge of Python, and here we are.

## Where are you planning to go?
Well first, I've got to properly implement all of the endpoints in the API, and from there, I don't really know I guess?
